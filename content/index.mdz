A place to document things I learned about Janet so I do not have to figure them out again...


## Misc

@ul{
 @li{@code[map] takes up to 4 inputs, so you can use it to zip arrays together}
 @li{@code[values] creates an array from values returned by a fiber}
 @li{@code[generate] is an easy way to create generators using @code[loop] syntax}
}
